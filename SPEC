repurpose to browser.
Logic in javascript. Rendering in HTML5 canvas.

You are "."
You shoot laser on a reasonable timer.
. is always centered.
There are always hundreds of "o" that go straight at you.
There is a maze to avoid.

. is white.
Lasers are white.
o's are red.
Maze is neon blue.

x's are more rare and they shoot at you with yellow lasers.

High scores can be kept.

Control scheme:
Mouse + Keyboard
* WASD move
* Mouse XY - aim
* Mouse LB - shoot. Hold to shoot on a timer
Joystick A
* Left Analogue stick - move
* Right Analogue stick - aim & shoot
Joystick B
* D-Pad - move
* 0 - shoot
* L1, L2 - aim counter-clockwise slow/fast
* R1, R2 - aim clockwise slow/fast

Your aim is to solve the maze in the designated time or lose a life.
Touching anything red/yellow will cause you to lose a life.
If enemies touch your white lazers, they lose hitpoints or go away.
o's and x's have random (but reasonable) amounts of hitpoints. (i.e. 1, 3, 7, whatever).

Every 5 levels or so there is a boss instead of a maze escape. They have 42 hit points and give you 10000 points. They are big (say... 5x5 cells considering an o to be one cell) and shoot a couple of parallel lasers.



Dot {
    float x, y;
    float shootingAngle;
    bool shooting;
    float movingAngle;
    bool moving;
}

Enem {
    int hp; // influences color from green to red (255 max)
    float x, y;
    enum { X, O, BOSS } type;
}

Lasr {
    float x, y;
    float angle;
    float length;
    enum { WHITE, YELLOW } color;
}



Map should be procedurally generated. First implementation: define a couple of standard rooms with possible NWSE exits and paste them together.

Spwn {
    float x, y;
    int num; // num badies spawned, or <0 for infinite
}

Room {
    int predefinedType;
    struct {
        bool N:1, W:1, S:1, E:1;
    } exits;
    list<Spwn*> spawnPoints;
    list<Enem*> enemies;
    Room* adjacent[4];
}



Window is 640x480, a room should be like 400x400.
A room is 1.0fx1.0f in terms of in-game sizes.



Procedural map generator:
* pick one random block
* foreach spawn point, set it active or inactive, finite or infinite skewed towards finite and towards very large numbers
* for each potential exit, flip a coin. If heads, generate a new room in that direction unless 100 rooms have already been generated. Repeat.
* pick a random room. This one will be the teleporter/boss room.




Expansion
=========

Powerups:
    * Shortgun/Spazer
    * Slow moving energy ball that continuously hurts.
    * Shield
    * Speed

Downgrades:
    * Short laser
    * Half Damage
    * Kaput
    * Slow

More bosses.
Save the hostages situation.
More annoying enemies.
